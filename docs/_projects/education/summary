I love turning equations into intuition—animations, simple experiments, and visual tools that show what the math is really doing.
I enjoy teaching and finding ways to see what’s happening behind the math. My goal is to make concepts feel obvious: if you can picture it, you can reason about it—then the equations become tools, not obstacles.
