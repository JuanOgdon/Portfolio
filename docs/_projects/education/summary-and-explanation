I love turning equations into intuition—animations, simple experiments, and visual tools that show what the math is really doing.
I enjoy teaching and finding ways to see what’s happening behind the math. My goal is to make concepts feel obvious: if you can picture it, you can reason about it—then the equations become tools, not obstacles.


I’ve always been fascinated by visualizing math. Since the beginning of my engineering studies, I’ve pursued a deeper understanding of the mathematics behind my work through visualization, often geometrically. The 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel has been an incredible resource, sparking countless insights throughout my studies.

The Joukowsky transformation is a classic method in aerodynamics for transforming a circle into an airfoil-like shape. It is a conformal mapping that allows us to study the lift and other aerodynamic properties of airfoils analytically.

Key components of the transformation:

p: Horizontal displacement of the circle's center. It influences the thickness of the resulting airfoil.

m: Vertical displacement of the circle's center. This introduces camber (curvature) to the airfoil.

Circle Geometry: The circle must always pass through the point "h" on the positive real axis, this ensures proper transformation of the trailing edge.

Center Point (denoted as C in the video): The circle's center at −p+m*i determines the final shape of the airfoil.

The result is an aerodynamic profile whose characteristics can be tailored by adjusting these parameters, enabling precise (although limited by the family of curves) control over the airfoil's design and performance.
