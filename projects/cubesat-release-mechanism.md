## TL;DR
- **Goal:** Achieve reliable, low-variance solar panel release times for CubeSat-class mechanisms.
- **Result:** µ = 0.42 s, σ = 0.05 s across 50 tests; identified and justified removal of 2 outliers via Grubbs test.
- **Role & Skills:** Design, test planning, Python/Excel analysis, reporting for conference.

## Methods
Outlined the test bench, trigger mechanism, and data workflow. Included standard deviation and outlier policy consistent with engineering practice.

## Results
Histogram + boxplot; table summary; discussion of repeatability.

## What I learned
Test design under constraints; statistical rigor; technical presentation.
